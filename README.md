# Feedback Form

Welcome to the Feedback Form mini-project! This web application allows users to leave feedback for hypothetical services, as well as providing statistics on the number of good, neutral, and negative feedback entries, the total number of feedback entries, and the percentage of positive feedback recorded. The project was developed using React, CSS, styled-components, and the nanoid library, with Parcel as the build tool.
